Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose Authentication
This is an example of how to create a simple authentication system using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. This example uses an express server to handle the requests and MongoDB as the database. The Mongoose is used as the Object Document Mapping(ODM) library for MongoDB.

Prerequisites

 Node.js and npm installed
 A MongoDB Atlas account
 A MongoDB Compass account

Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder
2. Run npm install to install the dependencies
3. Create a new MongoDB cluster on MongoDB Atlas and connect to it using MongoDB Compass
4. Replace the MongoDB URL in app.js with the URL of your cluster
5. Run the server with the command node app.js
6. Open your browser and go to https://demo-auth-production.up.railway.app/signup to sign up for a new account
7. Go to https://demo-auth-production.up.railway.app/login to log in to your account
8. Go to https://demo-auth-production.up.railway.app/ to see your username displayed if you're logged in

Code Explanation

The app.js file is the main file of the application. It sets up the express server and connects to the MongoDB cluster using Mongoose.
The signup route is used to create a new user by saving their information to the database.
The login route is used to log in an existing user by checking their email and password against the information stored in the database.
The / route is used to check if a user is logged in and display their username.
session are used to store the user's information during the session.
MongoStore is used to store the session information in MongoDB, so it persists across multiple requests.
userSchema is used to define the structure of the user data that will be stored in the database.
The User model is created using the userSchema and is used to interact with the users collection in the MongoDB database.

Conclusion

This example provides a basic understanding of how to create an authentication system using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It can be easily extended to include additional features such as password hashing and email verification.
